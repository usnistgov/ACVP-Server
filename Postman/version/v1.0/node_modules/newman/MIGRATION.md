## Migrating from V3 to V4

Newman v4.0 drops support for Node v4 and deprecated v2 CLI options. Also, the inbuilt HTML reporter has been moved to a standalone reporter.

### Upgrading Node.js
Newman v4 requires Node.js >= v6. [Install Node.js via package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).

### Discontinued CLI Options
Newman v4 drops support for all the deprecated v2 CLI options, check [V2 to V3 Migration Guide](#v2-to-v3-migration-guide).<br/>
For the complete list of supported options, see the [README](README.md)

#### --no-color
This option is dropped because of the changes made to the `color` option. See the section below for more details.

### Using `color` option
The behaviour of this option is changed in both CLI and Library. Unlike Newman v3.x, this option alone can be used to enable
or disable colored CLI output.

#### CLI

##### 1. Enabling colored output

###### V3 command
```console
$ newman run collection.json --color
```

###### V4 equivalent
```console
$ newman run collection.json --color on
```

##### 2. Disabling colored output

###### V3 command
```console
$ newman run collection.json --no-color
```

###### V4 equivalent
```console
$ newman run collection.json --color off
```

#### Library

##### 1. Enabling colored output

###### Using V3
```javascript
newman.run({
    collection: 'collection.json',
    reporters: ['cli'],
    color: true
}, callback);
```

###### V4 equivalent
```javascript
newman.run({
    collection: 'collection.json',
    reporters: ['cli'],
    color: 'on'
}, callback);
```

##### 2. Disabling colored output

###### Using V3
```javascript
newman.run({
    collection: 'collection.json',
    reporters: ['cli'],
    noColor: true
}, callback);
```

###### V4 equivalent
```javascript
newman.run({
    collection: 'collection.json',
    reporters: ['cli'],
    color: 'off'
}, callback);
```

**Note:**
The default behaviour is to detect color support for the terminal and act accordingly.
This behaviour can be modified by setting the color option to `on` or `off` respectively.

### Using HTML Reporter
The inbuilt HTML reporter has been moved to a standalone reporter. Install it with:
```console
$ npm install -g newman-reporter-html
```
Installation should be global if newman is installed globally, local otherwise. (Remove `-g` flag from the above command for a local installation.)

The complete installation and usage guide is available here: https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman-reporter-html

### Deprecated support for the v1 collection format
Newman >= v4 deprecates support for the v1 collection format.<br/>
Use the [Postman Native app](https://www.getpostman.com/apps) to export collections in the v2 format.

### CSV auto parse
A [fix][pr1609] has been made to avoid parsing numbers inside quotes.<br/>
Example, `"000123"` will not be parsed to `123` like before.

Fixes issues: [#1100][i1100], [#1215][i1215] & [#1346][i1346]

### Default timeouts
All timeouts now have the default value of infinity. [#1630](pr1630)

## Migrating from V2 to V3

Newman v3.0 is a complete rewrite of Newman from the ground up, which works well with other Node libraries, and
allows flexibility for future features such as parallel collection runs, or performing parallel requests within the
same run. Above all, Newman now uses [Postman Runtime](https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-runtime/) in order to
provide a consistent experience on Postman Apps and on CLI.

### General overview of features

1. Newman collection runs now happen with the `run` command. See sections below for more examples.
2. More informative terminal output with colourful details of what went wrong, and most importantly, where it went
   wrong.
3. Ability to load environment, globals, collections as well as iteration data from urls.
4. Friendlier usage as a library. A lot of use-cases depend on the use of Newman as a Node library, and v3.0 is written
   with a library-first mindset.
5. Internally things (by things, we usually mean code) have been better organised to allow faster implementation of
   features.

### Changes since v2.x

Migrating to Newman v3.x for most simple use cases is a trivial affair. We have taken care to support older CLI options.
Which means, if you upgrade, it should just work! Having said that, we would soon discontinue the older CLI options and
you should start using the new ones. Furthermore, the new features are only available via the new CLI options.

Since Newman 3.x is a complete rewrite, expect it to have subtle behavioural differences when compared with Newman v2.x,
your reports will look a bit different, the CLI output is a complete overhaul, your collection runs will inherit all the
qualities of the new Postman Runtime (jQuery deprecation, discontinuation of DOM), etc. For a comprehensive list of
usage changes across Newman V2 and V3, look at the table provided below.

As such, if there is something specific that not working with respect to v2.x or any workaround that you were doing,
we will be glad to chat and find out if they can still be done. Simply join the #newman channel on our [Slack
Community](https://www.getpostman.com/slack-invite).

### HTML, XML and other outputs are now "reporters"
Newman v3 adopts a "reporter" model and as such features that were previously part of Newman core has now been moved
into reporters. Consequently, the CLI options for these features are now accessible via `--reporter-*` options. You
might also notice that some of the functionalities of reporters have been reduced even though the reporter outputs have
become more detailed. This is to offload non-essential codebase away from Newman core and be later made pluggable into
external reporter plugins.

### --no-color is automated
Newman now automatically detects lack of colour support and as such this flag does not need to be explicitly provided
any more. However, `--no-color` is still available to force not to use colors in terminal output.

### Discontinued CLI Options

#### -S --noTestSymbols
This switch no longer has any effect. Newman v3 effectively handles unicode output on Windows Platform.

#### -p, --pretty
This switch used to render exported JSON files in newman v2 in a pretty format. Newman v3 always exports in pretty
format and as such, this switch is now not needed. If you want to use compressed export formats, run the exported files
through some JSON minifier.

## V2 to V3 Migration Guide

The following tables enumerate the options that have either been deprecated / discontinued, or renamed in Newman V3. The
V3 equivalents provided in the second column are intended for use with the `run` command (described below), and will not
work in V2 mode. The original options from V2, still work (without `run`, of course) however, but will be removed in the
next major Newman release.

In the V2 option status column, deprecated implies that the corresponding CLi option has been left for backward
compatibility and will be removed in the next major Newman release. A status of discontinued implies that the option is
no longer supported, or is implemented by default.

Options missing from the migration tables have been left as they were from Newman V2. For the complete list of supported
options, see [README.md](https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman/blob/release/3.x/README.md)
